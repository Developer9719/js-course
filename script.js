 * Factory Function:
 * - Simpler syntax, just a regular function that returns an object
 * - No need to use 'new' keyword or 'this' keyword
 * - Can leverage closures for private variables and functions
 * - More flexible, can return different types of objects based on input parameters
 * 
 * Object Constructor:
 * - Requires the use of 'new' keyword and 'this' keyword to define properties and methods
 * - More rigid structure, always returns an instance of the same type of object
 * - Prototype inheritance can be used to share methods and properties between instances
 * - Can be less intuitive for beginners due to the use of 'new' and 'this'

// ES6 Modules
/** Before ES6 Modules
 * All code in a single file or multiple files combined into one
 * Variables and functions in one file can conflict with those in another file
 * HTML
<script src="one.js" defer></script>
<script src="two.js" defer></script>

// one.js
const greeting = "Hello, Odinite!";

// two.js
console.log(greeting);
// Logs "Hello, Odinite!"
// If two.js loads before one.js, it will throw an error because greeting is not defined yet

After ES6
- You can export variables and functions from one file and import them into another file

- Named Exports
  - Place export before variable or function declaration
  - Put all varaibles and functions you want to export in curly braces export { var1, var2, func1 } at the end of the file
  - In the other file use import { var1, var2, func1 } from './file.js' to import them

- Default Exports
  - Can only export 1 thing
  - Use export default before variable or function declaration
  - Import it in the next file by giving it any name import anyName from './file.js'

Entry Point
- Only link 1 script in the HTML file
- This is the entry point that imports everything else
- Example: main.js
- Need to add the type="module" attribute to the script tag in HTML

/**
 * Single Responsibility
 * - A class, object, function or anything similar should have all properties and actions related and accomplishing 1 goal
 * Loosely Coupled Objects
 * - Each class, object, function or similar should be standalone as much as possible and not rely on others. This allows you to change 1 thing without worry of impacting
 * multiple other areas of the project
 * SOLID Priciples
 * - Single Responsibility
 * - Open Closed
 *   - code should be open for extension but closed for modification 
 * - Liskov Substitution 
 *   - any class should be substitutable for its parent class without unexpected consequences
 * - Interface Segregation 
 *   - an entity should never be forced to implement an interface that contains elements which it will never use
 * - Dependance Inversion 
 *   - high level code should never depend on low level interfaces, and should instead use abstractions
